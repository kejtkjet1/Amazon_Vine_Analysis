    - .01% of vine reviews were paid 5 star
    - 99% of non vine reviews 5star

## Summary

1. It appears that there are so few vine members and percentage of 5 star and vine is so low - It seems lower among vine than non vine members.
2. There does not seem to be a bias among vine reviews. 
3. A helpful analysis would be to check how many vine vs non vine fell in all the lower star ratings.
