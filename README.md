    - .01% of 5 star reviews were vine
    - 99.9% of 5 star reveiws were non vine

## Summary

1. It appears that there are so few vine members and percentage of 5 star and vine is so low - It seems lower among vine than non vine members.
2. There does not seem to be a bias among vine reviews. 
3. A helpful analysis would be to check how many vine vs non vine reviews fell in all the lower star ratings.
